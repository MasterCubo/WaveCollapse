# Wave Collapse Function

simple Wave Collapse Function demonstration using T peices inspired by The Coding Train's Coding Challenge 171.

I plan to continue this project by making a Mondrian generator, and updating the edges to include 3 colors.

Update: I did! view it [here](https://mastercubo.github.io/WaveCollapse)
